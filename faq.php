				<h3>General Questions</h3>
				<div class="accordion toggle fancy radius clean">
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Can I get additional support after purchase?</h5>
						<div style="" class="ac-content">For sure. At ePropel, customer satisfaction is our top priority. We are happy to provide complementary support for you every step of the way, from before to after your purchase. Simply contact us at support@ePropel.ca or give us a call at 647-393-6444. Need our help to modify a page on your website? No problem. We are happy to help.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>What do I do in the event that I am not completely satisfied with my purchase? </h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">If you are not satisfied with your purchase, we will provide you with a full refund. Rest assured. There are no hidden terms and conditions, no risks, and no hassle. It is that simple.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How much do you charge for your services?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">Every project is unique and tailored to your needs, therefore the price will vary on a project to project basis. However, no matter what price we charge, we will always ensure that it is the best offer that you find and that you are maximizing the return on your investment.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Why not use a website builder?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">Website builders are great. They let you have a website up and running quickly and easily, often at lower costs than what a firm like us offers. But with website builders, they offer limited functionality, and you end up fiddling with settings (and diving into code) for a result that will not meet your standards. Website builders are a great place to start, but if you want full control over the feel and experience of your site, the ability to easily track sales and traffic, or just want someone to handle the mess of code for you, you know who to call.</div>
                        
					</div>
                    <div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Can I hire a freelancer to do the same thing?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">Go for it. There are plenty of talented freelancers to be found. However, freelancers do not have the same experience that we do and are often limited to just one area of expertise. <br>ePropel takes pride in having team members come from a variety of backgrounds including web development, graphic design, and business. Be it developing a stunningly beautiful website that reflects the brand to creating appealing posters to help you generate more sales, we do it all! Plus, freelancers are often not accountable. They tend to move on to other projects and not provide you with the customer support services that you need after your purchase. For us, our team are dedicated to your company’s success. We take great pride in going above our customer’s expectations by providing you with complimentary free support after your purchase. </div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>What do you sell?</h5>
                        <div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">Simple answer? Digital marketing, web development, graphic design and any combination of these services so we can help establish an online presence for your company that will get you more sales. 
                            <br>Complicated answer? We sell time, expertise, and peace of mind. You don't need to touch code. Or worry about designing and making something look nice. You tell us what to do, and we make sure that it gets done so you can focus on your own business.</div>

				<h3>Referral Program Questions</h3>
				<div class="accordion toggle fancy radius clean">
					<div class="ac-item"> <!-- ac-active -->
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Do I get paid for referring someone for your service?</h5>
						<div class="ac-content" style="display: none;">Yes. For every successful referral, we will pay you 10% of the project costs, up to $100. Their business will benefit from my company’s services while you will benefit from the referral bonus. So if you know anyone or any businesses who needs web development, graphic design, or digital marketing services, please refer them to us and we will be in contact with you for your referral bonus.</div>
					</div>
                    <div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How are the referral payments paid out?</h5>
						<div class="ac-content" style="">We can pay you for your referral in any method that is convenient to you, including by online transfer, by cheque, and by cash.</div>
