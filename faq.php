				<h3>General Questions</h3>
				<div class="accordion toggle fancy radius clean">
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Can I get additional support after purchase?</h5>
						<div style="" class="ac-content">Yes. At ePropel, we place customer satisfaction as our top priority. We are happy to provide complementary support for you every step of the way, from before to after your purchase. Simply contact us at support@ePropel.ca or give us a call at 647-393-6444. Need our help to modify a page on your website? No problem. We are happy to help.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>What do I do in the event that I am not completely satisfied with my purchase? </h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">If you are not satisfied with your purchase, we will provide you with a full refund. Rest assured. There are no hidden terms and conditions, no risks, and no hassle. It is that simple.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How much do you charge for your services?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">The price varies depending on the needs of each service project. However, no matter what price we charge, we will always ensure that it is the best offer that you find and that you are maximizing the return on your investment through the purchase of our services.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Are there free versions of this service?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">You have to pay to get this service. Alternatively, the free versions are very limited and not as good. It also takes many hours for you to work on it when you could have been using those hours to focus on your business activities. With ePropel, our custom services will get you what you want, in the way that you want it. Our team will finish your project to perfection and we will not stop until we are successful.</div>
					</div>
                    <div class="ac-item">
						<h5 class="ac-title"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>Can I hire a freelancer to do the same thing?</h5>
						<div style="display: none;" class="ac-content">Yes, but freelancers do not have the same experience that we do and are often limited to just one area of expertise. Our company has team members come from a variety of backgrounds including web development, graphic design, and business. This allows us to provide you the complete package. Whether it is developing a stunningly beautiful website that communicates the right message to your audience to creating appealing posters to help you generate more sales, we do it all! Plus, freelancers are often not accountable. They tend to move on to other projects and not provide you with the customer support services that you need after your purchase. For us, our team are dedicated to your company’s success. We take great pride in going above our customer’s expectations by providing you with complimentary free support after your purchase. </div>
